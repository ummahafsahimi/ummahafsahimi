## Hi there 👋
## This is Himi — DevOps & Geospatial Engineer, shipping production‑ready solutions

I design elegant, scalable infrastructure and build automation that removes friction from engineering teams.  
My background blends **DevOps, Cloud, CI/CD, Linux, Python automation, and advanced SAR/InSAR analytics** — a mix that lets me solve problems from both a systems and data perspective.

I love creating clean pipelines, intuitive workflows, and infrastructure that feels effortless.

- Cloud-native DevOps (AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker, Ansible, Prometheus)
- CI/CD pipelines that scale with teams
- Python automation for infrastructure + geospatial workflows
